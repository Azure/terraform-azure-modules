# (Optional) Unit tests

Unit tests are mainly for some complicated logics in Terraform code. We can extract the expressions containing complicated logics to `local` blocks, and perform tests against `local` expressions. Unit tests are optional, if they are composed please put the test code in `test/unit` directory.

Specifically, create a symlink in `unit-test-fixture` directory pointing to `variable.tf` and `locals.tf`, then `unit-test-fixture` will be a Terraform module which contains only `variable` and `locals` block. Unit tests can be created for this module.

Make sure that unit tests does not involve any `resource` or `data` related to outside services. To verify the test results, an independent `outputs.tf` file can be added to the unit test folder to hold the outputs of the expressions in `local` need to be verified. `resource` and `data` that does not depend on outside services like `null_resource`, `random_id` can also be used.
